How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Always testing! When I started to learn how to code, I remember running it or testing it after every single line... just in case I messed up. Since, I have been able to better my skills writing tests that truly ensure a functional and secure program.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I stick to what the users say. I try not to get overly complex when interpreting the requirements. I tend to get a little too creativity and stray farther from what the user truly wants. I have since been staying true to what the requirements are.

How do I approach designing software?
I always start with an end goal in mind. With that, I know that it will likely look different by the time I get there. I take a very iterative approach to building as I do not like to break something down just to build it back up.
